== Module Federation & Authentication

This host application exposes authentication components and utilities for consumption by remote microservices through Module Federation.

=== Exposed Components

The following authentication components are available to remote modules:

* `host/auth` - Complete authentication module (recommended)
* `host/AuthContext` - Authentication context and hooks
* `host/AuthService` - Keycloak authentication service
* `host/UserMenu` - User menu component with login/logout
* `host/AuthLoader` - Loading component for auth states
* `host/ProtectedRoute` - Route protection component
* `host/AuthDebug` - Debug component for authentication

=== Quick Start for Microservices

```javascript
// In your microservice
import { useAuth, ProtectedRoute } from 'host/auth';

function MicroserviceApp() {
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <div>Welcome {user?.name}!</div>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  );
}
```
